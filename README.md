# The-Reed-App
**The Reed App** is a full-stack web application built with **Django**.
A web app for analysing oboe and bassoon reed cane characteristics and optimising reed-making through data-driven insights.

*This app is still under construction. I put in the repository from time to time when part of the app is done. 

# The Reed App

**The Reed App** is a web-based tool designed to help bassoon and oboe reed makers analyse, track, and optimise cane characteristics before assembly. By inputting parameters such as thickness, hardness, density, and flexibility, users can collect meaningful data and visualise the relationships between input materials and the final reed quality.

ðŸŽ¯ **Key Features:**
- Customizable data entry parameters 
- Visual analysis of trends between cane characteristics and finished reed performance
- Scoring system (1â€“10) for evaluating finished reeds: Perceived stiffness, Playing ease, Global quality score, Intonation, Tone colour / Brightness, Response time. etc
- Statistical insights to support better reed-making decisions
- Clean and intuitive user interface, most of the detailed information pops up by hovering

**Parameters:**
**Environmental & Material:** Temperature, Humidity, Location, Elevation, Air pressure, Cane Brand, Harvest Year, Gouging Machine, Diameter, Thickness, Hardness, Flexibility, Density, Shaper, Staple(oboe), Profile model, time of rehearsal or concert. 

**Evaluations:** Playing Ease, Intonation, Tone Colour, Global Quality.
**Memo**


ðŸ”§ **Built with:**
- Django
- Python / JavaScript / HTML / CSS
- Data visualisation libraries - coming soon

ðŸ§ª Whether you're a professional reed maker, a student, or a curious performer, The Reed App helps bring clarity and consistency to the art of reed-making.
