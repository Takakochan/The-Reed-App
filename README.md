# The-Reed-App
A web app for analyzing oboe and bassoon reed cane characteristics and optimizing reed-making through data-driven insights.

*This app is still under construction. I put in the repository time to time when part of app is done. 

# The Reed App

**The Reed App** is a web-based tool designed to help bassoon and oboe reed makers analyze, track, and optimize cane characteristics before assembly. By inputting parameters such as thickness, hardness, density, and flexibility, users can collect meaningful data and visualize the relationships between input materials and the final reed quality.

ðŸŽ¯ **Key Features:**
- Customizable data entry parameters (e.g., thickness, hardness, etc.)
- Visual analysis of trends between cane characteristics and finished reed performance
- Scoring system (1â€“10) for evaluating finished reeds, Perceived stiffness, Playing ease, Global quality score, Intonation, Tone color / Brightness, Response time. etc
- Statistical insights to support better reed-making decisions
- Clean and intuitive user interface

ðŸ”§ **Built with:**
- Django
- Python / JavaScript / HTML / CSS
- Data visualization libraries - comimg soon

ðŸ§ª Whether you're a professional reed maker, a student, or a curious performer, The Reed App helps bring clarity and consistency to the art of reed-making.
